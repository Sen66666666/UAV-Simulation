# UAV-Simulation
## Introduction
The aim of this task is to create a simple feedback control algorithm for position stabilisation of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS). Processing measurements from sensors, such as GPS location, to generate actuation commands that achieve a specific vehicle state (position), is a fundamental building block of robotics systems. Many advanced guidance and navigation methods depend on the fundamental ability of a robotic system to move to a designated 'point'.
